- This is an offline accounting app which keeps your data on the device itself and can work without an active internet connection
- To support adding an account for transactions, a feature to fetch account from Contacts app is there for which you need to give Contacts permission
- This app doesn't send any of your data over the internet. All the data is stored internally in the app installed on your device

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
